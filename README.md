# Obscura

##  User Story
As a Traveler I WANT to be able to search my destination and figure out the weather SO THAT I know how I am going to pack for my trip. I also WANT to be able to figure out how much money I will need to bring SO THAT I can get everything ready before hand. This will be more convenient to be done all at once so I don’t need to travel to different webpages and can be ready for a trip at a moment’s notice.
